    <p>Hi! I'm Teidor (pronounced teh-ee-door but call me chloe if that's easier). I enjoy a variety of interests which web dev is a part of and I hope to be a good developer.</p>
    <p>I'm an avid fan of books... cookbooks to be precise😁. Of course, I do other things besides read delicious dessert recipes; I watch food videos too which evens out.😉Just kidding. I like Greek, Roman and Norse mythology. There's anime too, photography and digital art but food takes priority on my interest list😌. </p>
    <p>I picked web design not for any grand reason unfortunately but because I want to be of assistance to a lot of my friends who are in the tech field. I recently completed a diploma program in biomedical engineering and the world of programming seemed interesting so i decided to get a closer look.</p>
    <p>I look forward to experiencing the challenges in creating codes that work as they should.</p>
    <p>Oh right. I didn't say where I'm from... I'm hoping someone would guess? Without checking out my bio...If that's possible and I'm 19.</p>
