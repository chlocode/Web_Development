            <h2>Name: Teidor Chloe Enyonam Alafegha-Quakumey</h2>
            <p class = name>The name's Teidor, pronounced teh(as in Ted)-ee-door. I'm Ghanaian(and part Nigerian).</p>
            <p class = middle>I'm currently exploring the various programming languages and tools to discover the one I prefer. So far, python seems to be my favorite language to code in because it makes me feel smart... unlike C.
                Despite my limited experience, I hope to learn a lot more programming languages than I do now as well as human languages. I started learning Gaelic (blame Norse mythology), Greek (still mythology) and Korean a while back and I can confidently say I'm quite terrible at all of themü•≤.
                My favorite thing to do is nothing...I mean, practicing for when I retire. Y'know, just getting a headstart so I'd be a pro when the time comesüòÅ.
                If I'm not debugging my error-filled codes, I'm bingeing k-drama series or shonen, or creating disastrous recipes. For the more productive hobbies of mine, there's random photography, labelling my scrawls as digital art, and admiring the Chevy Camaro and Kawasaki Ninja(for motivation).
                Looking at automechanics as the next adventure.
                I'm working towards a degree in Applied Tech at Brigham Young University- Idaho online. I hope to be proficient in front-end web development although my aim is to become a full-stack software engineer.
                My favorite quote is:
            </p>
            <h2 class = quote>"You are a child of God, of <em>infinite capacity</em>"</h2>
            <p>Gordon B. Hinckley</p>
            <p>Nice to meet you!ü§ó</p>
